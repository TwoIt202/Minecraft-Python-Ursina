# Minecraft on Python Ursina
I made the game Minecraft on Python with Ursina Engine. 
And I'll describe all versions of this Minecraft copy.

## Alpha 1.0 (September 24 / 2022)
The first Minecraft version.
We're spawning on the square with 25x25 grass blocks.
We can't destroy blocks or put blocks. We only can walk and jump.

You can make your own resource pack for this Minecraft in folder `resource_packs`

## Beta 1.1 (August 6 / 2023)
Update which changed all source code with classes. Added new generation.
Updated shadows and player can fly with **Space** and **Shift**.

Also added new system of saving worlds. And in folder **saves** you can find world **x64 World**.
To go there, you need to write in the input of the world name **x64**.

**WARNING**: The world is big and consists of generating 64x64 blocks. This version is not optimized, and can cause strong lags.

## Pre-Release 1.0 (June 1 / 2024)
The most important thing is to say that update is very cool, because it.. added.. **slabs**! 
Yes, this is really very cool because builders (who don't exist) very convenient to build with **slabs**!
This is the best update in my game development! Seriously, is it some kind of bullshit for someone **slabs**?
We can put these **slabs** with the R key and back with blocks with the same key.

These blocks have their slabs:
* Stone
* Cobblestone
* Oak Plank

Okay, that's not all, because now you can also create your own mods. But it’s not as epic as the **slabs**...
There's no guide "How to create mods" at the moment.. i'm too lazy to type it now.

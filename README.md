# Minecraft on Python Ursina
I made the game Minecraft on Python with Ursina Engine. 
And I'll describe all versions of this Minecraft copy.

## Alpha 1.0 (September 24 / 2022)
The first Minecraft version.
We're spawning on the square with 25x25 grass blocks.
We can't destroy blocks or put blocks. We only can walk and jump.

Also added new system of saving worlds. And in folder **saves** you can find world **x64 World**.
To go there, you need to write in the input of the world name **x64**.

**WARNING**: The world is big and consists of generating 64x64 blocks. This version is not optimized, and can cause strong lags.
